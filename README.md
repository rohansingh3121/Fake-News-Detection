# Fake News Detection
Consuming news from social media is becoming popular. The explosive growth of fake news and its erosion to democracy, justice, and public trust increased the demand for fake news detection systems. A comprehensive framework to systematically understand and detect fake news is necessary to attract and unite researchers in related areas to conduct research on fake news.

A large body of recent works has focused on understanding and detecting fake news stories that are disseminated on social media. To accomplish this goal, these works explore several types of features extracted from news stories, including sources and posts from social media. In addition to exploring the main features proposed in the literature for fake news detection, I present a set of features and measure the prediction performance of current approaches and features for automatic detection of fake news. My results reveal interesting findings on the usefulness and importance of features for detecting false news.


Fake news are those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources, or quotes. When someone (or something like a bot) impersonates someone or a reliable source to spread false information, that can also be considered as fake news. In most cases, the people creating this false information have an agenda, that can be political, economical or to change the behavior or thought about a topic.

There are countless sources of fake news nowadays, mostly coming from programmed bots, that can't get tired and continue to spread false information 24/7.

Serious studies in the past 5 years have demonstrated big correlations between the spread of false information and elections, the popular opinion or feelings about different topics.

The problem is real and hard to solve because the bots are getting better and are tricking us. Is not simple to detect when the information is true or not all the time, so we need better systems that help us understand the patterns of fake news to improve our social media, communication and to prevent confusion in the world.

### Purpose
I'll explain several ways to detect fake news using collected data from different articles. But the same techniques can be applied to different scenarios. I'll explain the Python code to load, clean, and analyse data. Then I will do some machine learning models to perform a classification task (fake or not).

### Data
Data comes from Kaggle (link is given below):
https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset


There are two files, one for real news and one for fake news with a total of 23481 "fake" tweets and 21417 "real" articles.

### Analysis
All of the analysis can be found in the notebook:
